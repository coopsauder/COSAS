COSAS is excited to offer a new Co-op Intake Application Workshop for the academic year 2020-2021. 

<img class="col-4" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static_files/assets/svg/{{ page.image }}">

The purpose of the application clinic is to assist potential incoming Co-Op students through the process and answer questions they have. The session will focus on why students should join Co-Op, the benefits of the program, and tips for making your application stand out.
