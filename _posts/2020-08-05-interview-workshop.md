As part of our intake support initiative, COSAS will be offering Interview Workshops to support aspiring Co-op applicants. We will be going over some good habits during group interviews and providing some insight into your senior peers' experiences. The session is for students who have made it past the application stage of the intake process.

This event will focus on preparing students for the group interview portion of the application process into the Co-op program. The clinic will touch on the professional conduct, interview tips, and reflections from current Co-op students. We will also offer practice break-out sessions so that participants can try out what they’ve learned and also work on their interview responses.
